## Project Description

The Wedding Website Template project is a collaboration between Good Memories, a local photography business, and I. The purpose of the project is to create a website template that can be used for engaged couples to share all the information about their upcoming wedding with their invitees. The template will feature a beautiful design that is developed with reusability in mind, making it easy to adapt for multiple couples to use for their own weddings.

The main features of the website include assistance confirmation (RSVP), a countdown to the wedding day, an events timeline, registry links, and an image gallery. The RSVP feature will allow invitees to confirm their attendance. The couple will also have the ability to view a live updating Google Sheet that lists all guests that have confirmed attendance. Additionally, the couple will receive a custom email notification every time a new guest confirms attendance. The countdown feature will allow couples to share the excitement of their big day with their guests. The events timeline will provide a clear schedule of events for the wedding day. The image gallery will showcase beautiful photographs taken by Good Memories or any photographs that they wish to share.
